Green Fridge
A web application that acts as your personal virtual fridge. It uses React and Domain.com to establish a well-designed webpage.

When the website is first opened, the landing page will be presented to the user. Then they will proceed to the login page, where users can choose to log in to their existing account or create a new one. When the user logs into their account, they will see a homepage where alerts about which food items are close to expiry/ exired are displayed. In addition, we will recommend recipes to the user based on the close to expiry food items in their fridge. The user can also choose to upload a picture of their reciepts/ manually enter new food items purchased.
